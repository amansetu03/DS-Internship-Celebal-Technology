## Task-T1 
<p>Develop a child class called "Bus" that derives from the "Vehicle" class. Seating capacity multiplied by 100 is the standard fare for any vehicle. For example, if the vehicle is a bus, an additional 10% must be added to the entire fare as a maintenance charge. Therefore, the ultimate amount for a bus ride will be the sum of the total fare and 10% of the total fare.</p><br>
