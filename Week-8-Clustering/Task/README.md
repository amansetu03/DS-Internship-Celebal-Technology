## What do you mean by clustering?
---> <span>Clustering is a machine learning technique used to group a set of objects or data points into clusters,
where objects within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
The goal of clustering is to identify natural groupings or patterns in the data without pre-labeling, 
making it an unsupervised learning method.</span>


## Analyze Customer data and perform 2D and 3D clustering using K Means Algorithm on given Mall customers dataset.

| CustomerID | Gender | Age | Annual Income (k$) | Spending Score (1-100) |
|------------|--------|-----|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1          | Male   | 19  | 15                  | 39                      |
| 2          | Male   | 21  | 15                  | 81                      |
| 3          | Female | 20  | 16                  | 6                       |
